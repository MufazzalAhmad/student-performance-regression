# ðŸŽ“ Student Performance Prediction

This project predicts student exam scores based on various influencing factors such as study time, parental education, and other socio-economic attributes. The task was assigned as part of my internship at **Elevvo Pathways**.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
The dataset used for this project can be downloaded from Kaggle:
ðŸ”— [Student Performance Factors Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lainguyn123/student-performance-factors)

After downloading the dataset (`Student_Performance.csv`), I first **uploaded and unzipped** it in Google Colab before processing.

## ðŸ›  Steps in the Project
1. **Data Loading & Exploration** â€“ Read CSV, check shape, and understand features.
2. **Data Preprocessing** â€“ Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and normalize data.
3. **Model Training** â€“ Implemented a regression model to predict exam scores.
4. **Model Evaluation** â€“ Calculated:
   - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
   - R-squared (RÂ²) score
5. **Visualization** â€“ Plotted actual vs. predicted scores for model evaluation.

## ðŸ“Š Example Output
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** ~5.42  
- **RÂ² Score:** ~0.61

## ðŸš€ How to Run
1. Download the dataset from Kaggle.
2. Upload it to Google Colab.
3. Unzip and load it into your environment.
4. Run the provided Python notebook (`student_performance.ipynb`).
